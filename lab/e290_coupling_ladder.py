"""E290 — THE COUPLING-CONSTANT LADDER — measuring the program's
load-bearing constant: the orthogonal-drift threshold at which an
established write's read dies. This docstring carries the registered
question + arms + bars VERBATIM from the dispatch letter, committed at
birth BEFORE any compute. Adjudicate against exactly this; no bar shopping.

THE QUESTION (dispatch verbatim): e285 (the sanctuary) found a 20.1%-of-
write orthogonal drift killed the read 330x with the budget held; its
t100 datum (7.2% drift -> 200x down) bounds the threshold at <= 0.07x —
a ONE-DRAW bound (R68's critic: the monotonicity assumed, the threshold
could sit at 0.5%). The ladder measures it. NOTE e288 just landed
(ERROR-GATED-HOLDS — active maintenance works); the constant prices when
maintenance is NECESSARY (below the threshold, no anchor needed).

THE ARMS (dispatch verbatim): "THE ARMS (the established quiet-formed 10k
fact, loaded bit-exact; the corpus stream 1:1; SGD-M, separate buffers,
orthogonal projection — the sanctuary form VERBATIM, only the BUDGET
varying): four rungs at total-drift budgets {0.1x, 0.02x, 0.004x,
0.0008x} of the write's norm 9.1788 (the geometric ladder from e285's
0.5x anchor point; each rung = the equal-share cap form at the smaller
budget). Read post g0 at t100/200/300/400; the realized drift per
milestone (the verification); no maintenance (the pure passive curve at
each budget)."

FROZEN BARS (dispatch verbatim; survival ratio = post g0 at t400 / the
committed loaded baseline 0.26464763283729553; the threshold = the
largest budget whose arm holds >= 0.5x):
  - TIGHT-CONSTANT: "the 0.1x arm dies (< 0.5x) AND some lower rung
    holds — the threshold located in the ladder's span; report the
    bracket + the curve shape (graded vs step)."
  - NO-PASSIVE-THRESHOLD: "ALL rungs die (< 0.5x) even at 0.0008x — the
    coupling is effectively unbounded; NO passive drift is safe;
    maintenance is ALWAYS necessary for a moving organism (the strongest
    fragility statement; e288's controller is then the only
    preservation)."
  - ROBUST-FLOOR: "the 0.1x arm HOLDS (>= 0.5x) — contradicting e285's
    single-datum bound (the draw or the phase timing mattered); the
    threshold is looser than 0.07x after all."
  - MIXED: "non-monotone across rungs — everything verbatim."

OPERATIONALIZATIONS (frozen HERE before compute; they fix the clauses,
they do not move the bars):
  * THE PHASE := 400 CORPUS steps per rung, NO install, NO maintenance
    (e283/e285's convention freeze verbatim); milestones t =
    100/200/300/400 corpus steps; each rung a FRESH instance from the
    same loaded fact.
  * THE VEHICLE := the committed QUIET-FORMED 10k fact (e261's serial cut
    completed by e264; e261_K10K_inst_resume.pt), loaded BIT-EXACT and
    gated THREE ways (artifact md5/size/step/traj/ledger + flat-md5 +
    behavioral read vs the committed literals — G_FACTLOAD); the room :=
    the fact's OWN committed K10K room (seeds 26113/26114), rebuilt +
    bit-gated vs e264_rooms.pt (G_ROOMK10K).
  * THE RUNG FORM := e285's SANCTUARY arm VERBATIM, only BUDGET_FRAC
    varying: SGD-M momentum 0.9 wd 0.0 at LR_STABLE = 0.01 x
    21.7385748014537 = 0.21738574801453703 x cosine_lr(t-1,1000) (the
    nominal schedule, md5-bound provenance), TWO SGD instances over the
    same params — opt_C (the ONLY one stepped) + opt_F (NEVER stepped;
    bitwise isolation probe every step), backward -> clip 1.0 ->
    g_perp = g - P_room(g) (CPU fp64, verified EVERY step) -> the
    equal-share per-step lr cap cap_t = ((BUDGET - S_{t-1})/(n-t+1))/
    ||b_t|| with b_t = 0.9*buf_{t-1} + g_perp; lr_t =
    min(LR_STABLE x cosine, cap_t); S += realized ||step||;
    triangle-guaranteed S_400 <= BUDGET.
  * THE BUDGETS := {0.1, 0.02, 0.004, 0.0008} x ||fact - base|| =
    9.1788432658723 (the geometric 0.2-factor ladder down from e285's
    0.5x anchor); slack 1e-5 absolute on S + cum (fp32 accumulation,
    e285's disclosed form).
  * THE CORPUS STEP := e268's registered form VERBATIM: 48 windows = 16
    original-host anchors (the same 60-window bank) + 32 random corpus
    windows; full-window CE; draws (aj_c(16), rj_c(32)) from THIS cell's
    ONE fresh registered generator seed 29001 (the family's per-cell
    rule: .../28301/28401/28501/28801/HERE 29001); ALL FOUR rungs draw
    the IDENTICAL sequence (each rung its own generator instance at the
    same seed) — bit-identical corpus batches across rungs, the BUDGET
    the rungs' ONLY delta.
  * THE SURVIVAL RATIO := post g0(t) / 0.26464763283729553 (the
    committed loaded baseline, PRIMARY; the session's loaded read
    co-reported).
  * THE ADJUDICATION READ := each rung's t=400 endpoint (all gate
    verdicts at the same endpoints); full milestone trajectories +
    realized-drift ledgers co-reported verbatim.
  * COMPOSITE := TEXTURE (any hard-gate failure — nothing adjudicated)
    -> NO-PASSIVE-THRESHOLD (all four rungs die) -> ROBUST-FLOOR (the
    0.1x rung holds) -> TIGHT-CONSTANT (the 0.1x rung dies AND >= 1
    lower rung holds AND the holds-pattern is monotone — a suffix of the
    rung list) -> MIXED (non-monotone across rungs — everything
    verbatim).
  * THE THRESHOLD BRACKET := in budget terms (largest holding frac,
    smallest dying frac above it]; co-reported in realized-drift terms
    (each bracketing rung's realized cumulative drift at t400 as a
    fraction of the write's norm — the ladder's measured constant).
  * THE CURVE SHAPE (reported, never a bar): GRADED (survival scales
    progressively across rungs) vs STEP (the transition to survival
    lands within one rung gap) — classified from the adjacent-rung
    factors, numbers verbatim.
  * HARD GATES (a failure HALTS): {G_NAMEFREE, G_SPLICE, G_BATTERY,
    G_ANCHOR, G_INSTMASK, G_PARENTS, G_BASE, G_ROOT, G_VMBIND, G_SPANBIND,
    G_PROJ, G_ROOMK10K, G_FACTLOAD, G_CORPUSGEN, G_LR_BIND, G_ORTH,
    G_BUFSEP, G_BUDGET} — G_ORTH/G_BUFSEP/G_BUDGET instantiated PER RUNG
    (all four must pass).
  * G_ORTH := per rung, max over ALL corpus steps of ||P_room g_perp||/
    ||g_perp|| < 1e-6 (checked every step).
  * G_BUFSEP := per rung, (i) isolation: opt_F snapshotted bitwise
    before every opt_C.step() and compared after (any mismatch HALTS);
    (ii) composition: ||P_room buf_C||/||buf_C|| < 1e-4 per milestone.
  * G_BUDGET := per rung, S_400 <= BUDGET + 1e-5 AND realized cumulative
    displacement ||theta_400 - theta_fact|| <= BUDGET + 1e-5; the ledger
    discloses budget_norm, S_400, realized cum, usage fractions, the
    cap's binding count, the lr price.
  * NO CONS (T259/e281); all four post states CHECKPOINTED.
  * NO TWIN (cited + hard-bound instead): e285's same-session
    UNPROTECTED-TWIN (ratio 1.47e-05x) + e283's committed reference
    (3.42e-05x) are the death class's record; the ladder's question is
    the PASSIVE floor, not the unprotected contrast.

REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (registered at birth, before compute):
  - P-e290a (the tight constant, the dispatch's expected reading): the
    0.1x rung's realized cumulative drift will land ~4% of the write
    (e285's cancellation ratio: cum ~ 40% of budget) — inside the lethal
    band e285 already measured at t100 (7.2% -> 0.0051x) — so the 0.1x
    rung DIES; the threshold sits at or below the 0.02x rung's realized
    ~0.8%: TIGHT-CONSTANT with the bracket in-span, or
    NO-PASSIVE-THRESHOLD if even ~0.03% (the 0.0008x rung's realized)
    kills by t400.
  - P-e290b (R68's critic branch): NO-PASSIVE-THRESHOLD — the threshold
    sits under ~0.5% of the write and the read dies at every rung by
    t400; the coupling is effectively unbounded; maintenance is ALWAYS
    necessary (the strongest fragility statement; e288's controller the
    only preservation).
  - P-e290c (the robust branch): ROBUST-FLOOR — e285's kill was
    draw/phase-timing sensitive; the 0.1x rung holds >= 0.5x at t400 and
    the threshold is looser than 0.07x after all.

COMPUTE ENVELOPE: 2,739,072 params (inside the <=100M free tier); bursts
<= 175s (dispatch 180), per-step thermal polls at a 78C margin, 40s
cooldowns (dispatch 30-60), the 84C never-past line (dispatch 85), polls
persisted to runs/_envelope_log.jsonl tagged e290:<ARM>:<phase>; CPU fp64
dense projections (pocketfft workers 2); CPU threads 4; the four rungs
run SEQUENTIALLY with cooldowns between — NO concurrent GPU jobs.

Outputs: runs/e290/{metrics.json (PROGRESSIVE), e290_coupling_ladder.png,
REPORT.md (executor-written), run.log (gitignored)}; checkpoints
runs/checkpoints/e290_*.pt (gitignored; md5s in metrics). No NOTES/
THINKING/QUEUE/STATE edits (dispatch; the coordinator folds). Commit + push
per phase.
