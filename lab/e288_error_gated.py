"""E288 — THE ERROR-GATED MAINTENANCE CELL — the build lane's fourth
form, R68's conditional cell triggered by e287's SAWTOOTH-CONFIRMED
(the mechanism real: every window a lift; the dosage short: the
maintenance used only 3.9% of the budget at a tiny applied lr). This
docstring carries the registered question + bars VERBATIM from the
dispatch letter + THE CONTROLLER'S FORMULA, committed at birth BEFORE
any compute. Adjudicate against exactly this; no bar shopping.

THE CONTEXT (e287's committed record, hard-bound below): the third
form SAWTOOTH-CONFIRMED — the name-only signal is a REAL maintenance
mechanism (win1 lift x2.819, win2 lift x3.916 — the drift-inversion
gone), the budget held by construction (S_corpus 4.4122 + S_maint
0.1772 = 4.5894 = 100.0% — a 96.1/3.9 split), the stream live (corpus
CE 0.9261 -> 0.8192), the read at t400 x0.0917 (t300 peak x0.1221) —
51x the passive twin. THE REGISTERED SURPRISE (T267): the name-only
gradient's in-room fraction sits AT 0.0610 == the corpus ~0.06 — the
room-frame is NOT the operative frame; the lifts ride another
geometry. THE NAMED DIAL (T267): THE SHARE — not the budget (held),
not the direction (proven): the allocation. e288 turns that dial.

THE DESIGN (the dispatch's ONE changed dial): e287's rig with the
maintenance dose ERROR-GATED — a self-correcting controller:

    at each maintenance step t (M=25 cadence): measure the read's
    current deficit on the SAME battery the bars read,
        deficit_t = max(0, BASELINE_READ - current_read) / BASELINE_READ
        with BASELINE_READ = 0.26464763283729553 (the committed
        loaded baseline),
    and set that step's maintenance lr as
        lr_m_t = LR_M_MAX * deficit_t        (the controller's law)
    then apply the SYMMETRIC BUDGET CAP (e287's cap machinery, kept):
        applied lr_m = min(LR_M_MAX * deficit_t, cap_m),
        cap_m = share_m / ||b_m||,  b_m = 0.9*buf_F + g_name (the
        exact pending in-step momentum), share_m = (B_M - S_maint)/
        (remaining maintenance events) — the SAME equal-share
        reservation form the corpus cap uses, per stream.

THE SICKER THE READ, THE STRONGER THE ANCHOR; when the read is
healthy the dose vanishes (deficit 0 -> lr 0 -> the step is a no-op
on parameters, the buffer state kept).

THE CALIBRATION (frozen HERE at birth, BEFORE compute): LR_M_MAX is
set so that IF every step ran at FULL deficit (deficit_t = 1 for all
16 events) the maintenance stream would consume ~40% of the budget —
deliberately redistributing e287's 96.1/3.9 split to ~60/40. The
arithmetic: LR_M_MAX := 0.40 x BUDGET / sum(e287's 16 committed b_m
norms) — the ONLY measured momentum ramp at this exact mechanism
(e287's ledger: 1.0000 -> 7.6076, sum 81.5736; md5-bound below) —
giving LR_M_MAX = 0.02250444534525284 (asserted at runtime against
the re-derived value). The 40% allocation is then STRUCTURAL: the
maintenance stream's own reservation B_M = 0.40 x BUDGET and the
corpus stream's B_C = 0.60 x BUDGET (the reservation split IS the
calibration's consequence — the one dial), each stream capped by the
same symmetric equal-share form, so S_total = S_corpus + S_maint <=
BUDGET by the triangle bound BY CONSTRUCTION (e287's machinery
verbatim, the pools split).

THE ARMS (the established quiet-formed 10k fact, loaded bit-exact;
the corpus stream 1:1; SGD-M at the stable lr):
  (a) ERROR-GATED (the build, the fourth form): e287's rig with the
      ONE changed dial — the maintenance lr is ERROR-GATED
      (lr_m_t = LR_M_MAX x deficit_t, capped at the stream's share of
      B_M). Everything else e287-verbatim: the NAME-ONLY CE on win_i's
      112 masked name positions (the true signal), the fact-side
      buffer (opt_F), the orthogonal corpus projection, the corpus-side
      cap (now over B_C), M=25 cadence. 400 corpus steps, 16
      maintenance steps.
  (b) NAME-FIXED-TWIN (the control): e287's NAME-MAINTAINED arm
      VERBATIM — the flat budget-fitted dose lr_m = min(MAINT_LR_BASE,
      cap_m) under e287's JOINT equal-share reservation over ALL
      remaining optimizer events (both streams one pool) — run
      same-session on THIS cell's shared stream (the dispatch:
      "ALSO run a same-session name-fixed twin at e287's exact
      settings if budget allows — prefer the live twin"). The arms'
      ONLY delta: the controller (+ the 40/60 reservation that
      calibrates it).

FROZEN BARS (survival vs 0.2646 at t400; the budget <= 100%; the
stream live) — VERBATIM from the dispatch:
  - ERROR-GATED-HOLDS: ">= 0.5x — THE FIRST ACTIVE SURVIVAL, by the
    controller; the build era's founding success."
  - STRONGER-SAWTOOTH: "0.0917x-0.5x (beats e287's 0.0917 but short
    of the bar) — the controller improves the curve; the dose-response
    named as the next dial."
  - NO-GAIN: "<= e287's band (< 0.09x) — the gating adds nothing; the
    flat-dose dose-response is the question instead."
  - MIXED: "anything else — everything verbatim."

REGISTERED READS (the dispatch): the per-step lr_m_t vs deficit_t
trace (the controller's actual behavior); the windows (>= 2 sampled,
both directions); the budget split; the name gradient's in-room
fraction (expect ~0.06 — T267's falsified-at-chance reading carried);
the corpus CE (live).

OPERATIONALIZATIONS (frozen HERE before compute; they fix the clauses,
they do not move the bars):
  * THE PHASE := 400 CORPUS steps + 16 maintenance steps interleaved
    (ERROR-GATED) / 400 + 16 (NAME-FIXED-TWIN); milestones t =
    100/200/300/400 corpus steps, read POST-maintenance.
  * THE VEHICLE := the committed QUIET-FORMED 10k fact (e261's serial
    cut completed by e264), loaded BIT-EXACT + gated THREE ways
    (G_FACTLOAD); the room := the fact's OWN committed K10K room
    (seeds 26113/26114), rebuilt + bit-gated vs e264_rooms.pt
    (G_ROOMK10K); THE MAINTENANCE WINDOWS := win_i (G_NAMEWIN,
    decode-gated — e287's corrected vehicle).
  * THE CORPUS STEP := e268's registered form VERBATIM on THIS cell's
    ONE fresh registered generator seed 28801 (the family's per-cell
    rule: .../28601/28801/HERE 28801); BOTH arms draw the IDENTICAL
    sequence; the install stream its own seed 28802.
  * "survival at t400" := post-maintenance g0 battery at t400 / the
    committed baseline 0.26464763283729553 (PRIMARY; the session
    denominator co-reported).
  * "the budget <= 100%" := S_total = S_corpus + S_maint <= BUDGET +
    1e-5 slack AND the realized cumulative displacement <= BUDGET +
    slack, BOTH arms (the twin under its joint pool; non-halting —
    a break routes the composite to MIXED, everything verbatim).
  * "the stream live" := e287's form VERBATIM: median of the ERROR-
    GATED arm's logged corpus-batch CE rows t in (300,400] vs rows t
    in [1,100]; improving := late < early; stable := late <= 1.05 x
    early; live := improving OR stable.
  * THE BAR BOUNDARY := e287's committed literal 0.09173075565244133
    ("e287's 0.0917"): STRONGER-SAWTOOTH requires ratio_400 STRICTLY
    above it; NO-GAIN covers ratio_400 <= it (the dispatch's "< 0.09x"
    parenthetical is the rounded form of the same boundary; frozen at
    the exact committed literal).
  * THE COMPOSITE := TEXTURE (any bind/isolation hard-gate failure —
    nothing adjudicated, HALT) -> MIXED-by-conditions (G_BUDGET blown
    OR G_ORTH failed, any ratio — no bar covers a broken standing
    condition; everything verbatim) -> ERROR-GATED-HOLDS (ratio_400 >=
    0.5 AND budget held AND stream live) -> STRONGER-SAWTOOTH
    (0.09173075565244133 < ratio_400 < 0.5 AND budget held AND stream
    live) -> NO-GAIN (ratio_400 <= 0.09173075565244133 AND budget held
    AND stream live) -> MIXED (everything else).
  * THE WINDOWS := the SAME two as e287/e286: t24/t25-pre/t25-post/t26
    AND t199/t200-pre/t200-post/t201 (>= 2, both directions — direct
    comparability with the parent ledgers); the lifts are READS never
    bar clauses in this cell (the dispatch's bars carry no lift
    condition).
  * THE CONTROLLER'S READ GATE := the g0 battery on the CPU eval net
    at the event instant (post-corpus-step, pre-maintenance), the
    SAME battery_cell the milestones read; at t25/t200 the gate read
    is cross-checked against the window pre-read (must agree to fp
    determinism).
  * HARD GATES (a failure HALTs): {G_NAMEFREE, G_SPLICE, G_BATTERY,
    G_ANCHOR, G_INSTMASK, G_NAMEWIN, G_PARENTS, G_BASE, G_ROOT,
    G_VMBIND, G_SPANBIND, G_PROJ, G_ROOMK10K, G_FACTLOAD, G_CORPUSGEN,
    G_LR_BIND, G_MAINTBIND, G_BUFSEP-isolation}; NON-HALTING (route
    the composite to MIXED): {G_ORTH, G_BUDGET, bufC-composition}.
  * NO CONS (T259/e281; e278-e287's committed form): the frozen bars
    read the WRITE and the DISPLACEMENT only; both arms' post-phase
    states CHECKPOINTED for any later landing pass.

REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (the executor's, frozen at birth):
  - P-e288a (the share hypothesis, T267's named dial): the ~10x dose
    (up to 40% of budget vs e287's 3.9%) lifts the curve above
    e287's 0.0917 — STRONGER-SAWTOOTH or ERROR-GATED-HOLDS; the
    windows show lifts larger than e287's x2.8/x3.9; the corpus side's
    smaller allocation (60%) slows the decay between maintenance
    steps.
  - P-e288b (the saturation/overshoot hypothesis): the read's response
    to the name signal may be sublinear in dose (the fact's name CE
    ~1.0-1.2 nats means the name is far from learned — but the lift
    mechanism's gain is unmeasured above the 0.011/step dose): a 10x
    dose could saturate early, lift sharply then plateau — or overshoot
    into oscillation (T266's sawtooth-as-oscillator reading); endpoint
    <= e287 -> NO-GAIN with the lr-vs-deficit trace the datum.
  - P-e288c (the gating-null reading): under e287-class traffic the
    read sits ~0.02-0.08 all phase, so deficit_t ~ 0.7-0.98 at every
    gate and the controller behaves as a ~flat near-max dose — the
    cell then reduces to the SHARE dial (still the registered
    question); the trace discriminates: a genuine recovery (read ->
    0.13+) would taper the dose visibly (deficit -> ~0.5).

COMPUTE ENVELOPE: 2,739,072 params (inside the <=100M free tier);
bursts <= 175s (inside the dispatch's 180s), per-step thermal polls at
a 78C margin, 40s cooldowns (the 30-60s window), the 84C never-past
line (inside the dispatch's 85C), polls persisted to
runs/_envelope_log.jsonl tagged e288:<ARM>:<phase>; CPU fp64 dense
projections; CPU probing threads 4; NO concurrent GPU jobs (the arms
run sequentially with cooldowns between). TIMESTAMPS:
datetime.now(UTC) only.

Outputs: runs/e288/{metrics.json (PROGRESSIVE), e288_error_gated.png,
REPORT.md (executor-written), run.log (gitignored)}; checkpoints
runs/checkpoints/e288_*.pt (gitignored; md5s in metrics). No NOTES/
THINKING/QUEUE/STATE edits (dispatch; the coordinator folds). Commit +
push per phase.
